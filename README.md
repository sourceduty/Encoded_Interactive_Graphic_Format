> Software concept for the creation, transmission and and interchange of interactive image and video files containing hyperlinks.

Encoded Interactive Graphic (EIG) files are similar to Graphic Interchange Format (GIF) files and could be independent of the hardware used in their creation or display and encoded with an application protocol.

The concept of creating software for the generation, transmission, and interchange of interactive image and video files containing hyperlinks introduces an innovative approach to multimedia engagement. By embedding hyperlinks within images or videos, users can interact with specific elements within the media, allowing for a more immersive experience. This interactive media could link to additional content, websites, or other multimedia, seamlessly integrating navigation and exploration directly within the visual material itself. Such a concept offers new possibilities for educational content, marketing, entertainment, and interactive storytelling.

For the transmission of these files, the software would need to support efficient formats that preserve both the visual quality and the functionality of embedded hyperlinks. Compression techniques and streaming capabilities would be essential to ensure smooth delivery, especially for large video files. Moreover, the system should account for cross-platform compatibility to allow users across different devices and operating systems to experience the same interactive features without loss of quality or interactivity. Cloud-based transmission and file-sharing services could be integrated to provide real-time updates and collaboration on interactive media projects.

The interchange of these files also brings potential for collaboration between users, where multiple individuals can contribute to the creation or modification of interactive media. This would involve a robust user interface that allows for easy hyperlink embedding, annotation, and editing of interactive elements. The interchange feature could utilize protocols for version control and file synchronization, ensuring that users can work together without overwriting important changes. Additionally, a marketplace or platform could emerge where users share and trade these interactive image and video files, creating a dynamic ecosystem for creative and commercial purposes.
